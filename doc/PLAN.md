## Interesting Breakout Variants

 * *Centipong* 

I think this variant of Breakout is extremely
interesting because the bricks are not static. 
This aspect introduces a new layer of 
complexity and fun to the game, since the player
not only has to keep tabs on where the ball is,
but also the movement of the moving bricks or centipedes. 
I think this adds difficulty and challenge which can be fun,
and one has to factor in different angles at which one should
hit the ball to make impact with the centipedes. Additionally, the
centipedes are also cute to watch and make the game a little more appealing and animate.

 * *Devilish*

Devilish seems to be a very cool variant of Breakout. By adding
a scrolling and flying feature, it makes the game more interactive
and avoids boredom by repetition, in my opinion. Different
passages, different worlds and the idea of flying combines the 
concept of Breakout with almost a fantasy world of sorts. The idea
of flying also requires a shorter reaction time which makes the game more 
challenging and fun.

* *Vortex*

Vortex, by having a periphery where you have to hit the ball
from all directions, engages the player more. Rather
than the conventional Breakout where you have to hit the ball
from the bottom, hitting the ball from all directions requires the player
to have more attention and keep track of more things. Seems like a 
fun and challenging variant!
